test results are mostly just product data, not really spc specific data
group test results by wafer
	check how many other units have been tested on wafer
	< 30 units monitor by product id
		less than 30, not enough data to determine health of wafer
	> 30 units monitor by wafer

	GUI should tell what chart is displaying

LM SPC is on-going. Uses units on the station passing or failing specs
to determine station health, rather than standardized SPC units

	- might have to consider underlying distributions for units, rather than
	relying on just the 30 units to formulate the distribution. With a guideline
	or general structure for a wafer to fit, the predictive capabilities may
	be much greater

	* would like to see the current test software and process to figure out
	where SPC software could fit in
		-> clearly it would go after a unit test
		-> thus need to know the kind of test data we get and the factors
		we calculate against
