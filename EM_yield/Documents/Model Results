Model Results:
1. COB test data vs. selection

GaussianNB: 0.687
SVC: 0.7458
RandomForest: 0.8130

RandomForest importances: PeakWL (this may be because we're looking at WL to find appropriate chips to use), Chirp, SMSR, ModulationFreq (not sure what this is)

Each of the above classifiers seems like additional data (even beyond ~2% of data being used, i.e. ~8k examples) is not improving scores - need to find either more features are a more complex model
