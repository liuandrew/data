Yield metrics
	* Analysis of historical order quantities
	* Connection of COB test data and LM test data
		- explore any correlations between key pieces of data
	* Scoring systems of LM

Ultimate value of LM units in storage depends on scoring and order
	* Scoring can also be considered a function of time in storage (inverse correlation)
	* Scoring can also be calculated as a function of the likelihood for passing tests of next stage compared against correlated/predicted scores
		- Requires ML to determine correlations for key test metrics
		- Requires comparison against either specs or another layer of ML to see pass rates

Final yield calculation is a function of change in sum of units in inventory over time
